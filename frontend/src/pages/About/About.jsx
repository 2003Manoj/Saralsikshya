            <p>
              Saral Sikshya was founded in 2020 with a simple yet powerful vision: to make quality education accessible
              to every student, regardless of their geographical location or economic background. What started as a
              small initiative to help students during the pandemic has now grown into a comprehensive online learning
              platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our journey began when our founder, Dr. Rajesh Kumar, noticed the challenges students faced in accessing
              quality educational resources. With his extensive experience in education and a passionate team of
              educators and technologists, Saral Sikshya was born.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, we serve thousands of students across the country, offering courses from Class 6 to Class 12,
              competitive exam preparation, and skill development programs. Our success is measured not just in numbers,
              but in the success stories of our students who have achieved their dreams with our support.
